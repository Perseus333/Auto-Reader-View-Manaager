> The most powerful reader view manager. Lets the user automatically enable the reader mode when using certain websites or enable it on all websites except those in the blacklist.

Get this add-on on Firefox!

## Description

This powerful add-on enables the user to manage how and when to enable read mode. To manage the extension just click its icon in the extension menu. It has two modes: Enable Reader View by default or not. The user can navigate effortlessly between the two modes by toggling the checkbox in the UI.

If it's set to automatically open all pages in reader mode it will do so in all websites regardless if they can be readerable or not. However, if the user adds a website to the blacklist, it will not be opened in reader view. 

The other mode, also known as Whitelist Mode, makes it so that only the websites added in the whitelist are automatically opened in reader mode.

## Future Plans
In the future versions, it is planned to add a toggle that allows the reader mode in only readerable websites. Aka, the ones where the reader button in the url bar appears. For more information about what is considered a readerable extension see: [this article](https://videoinu.com/blog/firefox-reader-view-heuristics/), or the [source code](https://github.com/mozilla/readability).

### Credits & Apologies
This extension was based and inspired by Florian Khort's [Activate Reader View](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/activate-reader-view/) add-on.

This was my first firefox add-on and the first time that I have coded in javascript really, so the code might be a bit wonky and inefficient. If you think you can improve the code please feel free to do so by creating a pull request on GitHub.
